1. What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  
How long did this overall assignment take you?
I think it is still very challenging, if I want to design a great personal homepage on the premise of using only HTML and CSS.
The most difficult part should be CSS. I don’t know how to modify and challenge the format. Many parameters are unfamiliar.
It took me almost one week.

2. What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
I try to use @media to assist. So that my webpage is still very user-friendly when accessed by mobile users. 
At the same time, access on the PC side also has good visual effects.


3. What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  
Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?
First I try to think about how to design my homepage and how to render it, using only HTML and CSS.
Then I tried to search some materials and reviewed the teacher's slides, and tried to get some new ideas to help me design my webpages.


4. Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
I think I will learn JavaScript by then. And I will try to use something that adds some JS. This can make my homepage more user-friendly. 
And try to use some external CSS libraries.

5. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I think this homework took more time than I expected. It was originally planned to be completed in 1 day, 
but in fact it took 3 days. I spent about 30 hours on this project.
